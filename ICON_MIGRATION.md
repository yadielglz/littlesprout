# Icon Migration Summary

## Overview
Migrated the entire application from emoji-based icons to Lucide React icon components for a more professional and consistent visual appearance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Icon Mapping Utility (`src/utils/iconMap.ts`)
- Created centralized icon mapping with both React components and emoji fallbacks
- Supports all action types: feed, diaper, sleep, nap, tummy, helmet, shower, medication, weight, height, temperature, vaccine, health, appointment, reminder
- Category icons: care, health, schedule, other

### 2. Updated App.tsx
- Imported Lucide React icons (Baby, Droplet, Moon, Shield, Shower, Pill, Scale, Ruler, Thermometer, Syringe, FileText, Calendar, Bell)
- Updated `fabActions` to use icon components instead of emoji strings
- All 13 action items now use appropriate Lucide icons

### 3. Updated FloatingActionButton.tsx
- Modified `ActionItem` interface to accept `string | React.ReactNode` for icon property
- Updated imports to include Lucide icons for category headers
- Modified rendering logic to handle both string (emoji) and React component icons
- Category icons now use proper Lucide components

### 4. Updated UnifiedActionModal.tsx
- Added import for `getEmojiIcon` utility
- Updated `getActionConfig` to use `getEmojiIcon` function instead of hardcoded emojis
- Updated all `submitAction` cases to use `getEmojiIcon` for consistency
- Updated iconMap for timer-based activities

### 5. Updated timerUtils.ts
- Added import for `getEmojiIcon` utility
- Updated `getTimerConfig` to use `getEmojiIcon` for all timer types (sleep, nap, tummy, helmet, shower)

## Icon Mappings

| Action Type | Lucide Icon | Emoji |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| feed | Baby | 🍼 |
| diaper | Droplet | 👶 |
| sleep | Moon | 😴 |
| nap | BedDouble | 🛏️ |
| tummy | Clock | ⏱️ |
| helmet | Shield | 🪖 |
| shower | Shower | 🚿 |
| medication | Pill | 💊 |
| weight | Scale | ⚖️ |
| height | Ruler | 📏 |
| temperature | Thermometer | 🌡️ |
| vaccine | Syringe | 💉 |
| health | FileText | 📝 |
| appointment | Calendar | 📅 |
| reminder | Bell | 🔔 |

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Icons now have a consistent, professional look across all devices
2. **Scalability**: Vector-based icons scale beautifully at any size
3. **Accessibility**: Better support for screen readers and accessibility tools
4. **Customization**: Icons can be easily styled, colored, and animated
5. **Consistency**: All icons follow the same visual language
6. **Future-proof**: Easy to switch or extend the icon library

## Backward Compatibility

- Emoji icons are still used in logged activities for backward compatibility
- The `getEmojiIcon` function provides a fallback for existing data
- User-facing UI now uses professional Lucide icons
- Logged data retains emoji icons for historical consistency

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Consider migrating logged activity icons to Lucide icons for full consistency
2. Add custom icons for specific baby care needs
3. Create icon variants for different themes (light/dark)
4. Implement icon animations for better user feedback
